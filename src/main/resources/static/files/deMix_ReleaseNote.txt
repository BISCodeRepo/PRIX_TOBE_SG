1. Requirement
deMix requires Java 1.7 or later. Visit http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html 


2. Usage
Command  : java -jar deMix.jar <options> <file>
Options  :
  -i <parameter_file> : Config file path for search parameters [Required]
  -o <results_name>   : Name of analysis results [Optional]
                      : If not specified, the file name in 'Peptide=' parameter is used as the results_name.
                      : results_name_DdeuAnal.tsv and results_name_HDXProfile.tsv are generated.


Example1 : java -jar deMix.jar -i foo.params -o hdx.foo
Example2 : java -jar deMix.jar -i foo.params
Test data is available at https://prix.hanyang.ac.kr/demix/TestSample.zip

3. Configure parameters
A deMix config file has to be given as text file (See foo.params in the current directory).
Each line of the file has the form of parameter=[VALUE].

 Example)
   Peptide= testdata/foo_pept.tsv
   CTRLData= testdata/ctrl_ms.mzXML
   HDXData=30s, testdata/d2o_30s.mzXML
   HDXData=60m, testdata/d2o_60m.mzXML
   MassTolerance= 0.1da

Peptide=[FILENAME]: Specifies path to the file of peptides (in TSV format)
                    The TSV file must include three columns for peptides, charge states, mz values.  
                    Make sure that their column names (in the header) are 'peptide', 'charge', 'mz'. 
                    They can be in any order. (See a sample file, foo_pept.tsv in the testdata directory)
                    The TSV file may include different columns (they will be ignored).

CTRLData= [FILENAME]: Specifies the spectra file of a control experiment without HDX
                      mzXML (centroid) file is allowed. 
		      Elution time spans of input peptides are determined using this file.

HDXData=[Label],[spectra file]: Specifies the spectra file of HDX experiments with the D2O labeling
                                mzXML (centroid) file is allowed. 
                                Multiple files can be specified using different labeling as below.
                                e.g., HDXData=30s, D:/mydir/my_d2o_30s.mzXML
                                      HDXData=20m, D:/mydir/my_d2o_10m.mzXML
                                      HDXData=30m, D:/mydir/my_d2o_30m.mzXML

MassTolerance=[MASS_TOLERANCE]: Sets a peptide mass tolerance in dalton or ppm. The default value is 10ppm.
                                e.g., MassTolerance=15ppm
                                e.g., MassTolerance=0.4da

Protein=[FILENAME]: Specifies path to the file of protein sequences (*.fasta format)
                    Optional. If it's specified, start and end positons of peptides will be reported.
                    e.g., Protein= D:/mydir/my_protein.fasta


4. Output (tab-separated)
1) *_HDXProfile.tsv : HDX analysis results. Each cell represents the deuterated numbers of input peptides under different conditions.
Column Name : Description
Id          : Index 
mz          : m/z value of the peptide ion
Charge      : Charge state of the peptide ion
Peptide     : Peptide
Protein     : Protein name [Shown only when a file of protein sequence is specified]                
PosFrom     : Start site of the peptide in the protein
PosTo       : End site of the peptide in the protein
StartScan   : Scan number when the peptide elution starts
EndScan     : Scan number when the peptide elution finishes
ApexScan    : Scan number when the peptide elution is at the peak
ApexRT(m)   : Retention time in minutes when the peptide elution is at the peak
D2OLabel    : Deuterated number of the peptide under D2O labeling conditions
            : If multiple conditions were analyzed, multiple columns will be shown with different names of D2O labeling contidions. 
            : Num1~Num2 means that two deuterated forms are observed for the peptide (more abundant form precedes).

2) *_DdeuAnal.tsv : For each peptide, detailed analysis results are shown including theoretical and observed deuterated isotopic distributions of input peptides. 
Column Name   : Description
Id            : Index 
mz            : m/z value of the peptide ion
Charge        : Charge state of the peptide ion
Peptide       : Peptide

1stDeu%       : Proportion of the deuterated form by 1stDeuNum
2ndDeuNum     : Second deuterated number if two deuterated forms are simultaneously observed
2ndDeu%       : Proportion of the deuterated form by 2ndDeuNum
PredictedDdeu : Theoretical deuterated distributions generated using predicted deuterated numbers (1stDeuNum or 2ndDeuNum) and their weights (1stDeu% or 2ndDeu%).       
              : Intentity values separated by ';' are shown. The first value is an intensity at the m/z of the mono-isotope, the second value is an intensity at the m/z of the second-isotope, etc.
StartScan     : Scan number when the deuterated peptide elution starts
EndScan       : Scan number when the deuterated peptide elution finishes
StartRT(m)    : Retention time in minutes when the deuterated peptide elution starts
EndRT(m)      : Retention time in minutes when the deuterated peptide elution finishes
ObservedDdeu  : Observed deuterated distributions, aggregated over elution time (StartScan~EndScan)
              : Intentity values separated by ';' are shown. The first value is an intensity at the m/z of the mono-isotope, the second value is an intensity at the m/z of the second-isotope, etc.
MatchedScore  : Match quailty between 'PredictedDdeu' and 'ObservedDdeu' (0.0~1.0, 1.0 is the best)
